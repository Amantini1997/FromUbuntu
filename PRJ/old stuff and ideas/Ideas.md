PRJ Ideas:

# Analytics

A software which, using object recognition, tracks students engagement:
- at what point of the lecture people get distracted;
- how much they are interested;
- how often people answer questions (for instance by looking at how often they raise the hand or how much they talk);
- their attendance, and so on....

# Keywords extraction and explanation

Given a text
- spot the most important words (**keywords**);
- scrape the internet for their meaning;
- look at the context of both the word in your text and the explanation found online;
- classify the explanations based on the relevance;
- add a tooltip to these keywords so that, once activated, it gives the user notions about the keyword.

# Interactive game to LEARN

Given a topic or, more generally, an IT branch or language
- identify the major concepts;
- create an interactive learning path;
- make it accessible to newbies and children;
- make it fun and enjoyable

# Interactive game to DECIDE CAREER

Some people do have preferences and predispositions to certain branches. What if, using an interactive game as described in the previous idea: 
- identify weakness and strengths (for aptitudinal versions), 
- identify interests (using clustering)

to recommend the right path to choose?
> - E.g. If they are good at math and love to create innovation, I can address them to the research field of AI or algorithms.
>- If they show propensity to meticulousness, I can address them to web design and UI/UX
> - etc.

# Text Simplification

Given a text
- Identify the hard concepts or words;
- Identify their meaning in the context;
- Replace them with valid synonyms and easier sentences


# Identifier of Mental conditions

Recent research provides evidence that text features in studentsâ€™ written and spoken production both in-person and online can be predictive of success in math and science domains. Automatically assessing mental states can provide teachers with a better understanding of how well their students are prepared to learn. This information may help teachers better manage the classroom, identify struggling students early on, and improve student learning


# Speech to Sign Language
Given a video:
- Convert the speech into a text;
- Convert the text into a sign language video.
