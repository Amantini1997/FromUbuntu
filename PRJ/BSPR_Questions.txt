- How can I link websites into my LaTeX file?

- Data structures and algorithms are pretty hard, I know this because I have 
seen many people expressing this idea in forums. Do I need to cite the forums
and/or the link to the topic for all of them?

- What format shall I use for the BSPR? I am using the one with chapters which 
leaves a lot of blank space, is that fine?
