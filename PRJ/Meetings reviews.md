# First Meeting

Problem space:

Working with machine learning in education [and then I have to come up with a specific problem]


I want to tackle this problem using deep learning:
- I will start decomposing the problem;
- I will compare different de
- ep learning algorithms and approaches;
- I will see which one performs better and choose the one that guarantees me a good solution, etc.

----

- you will need to demonstrate that you have clearly defined the **problem space** for your project. 
- You should discuss the **motivation and the scope of the project**, list its **aims and objectives** and **include a short bibliography** of relevant literature. 
- You should state what **software platform** (programming language(s), software packages, and software environment), **hardware platform** and **operating system**(s) you will be using. 
- You should also include a **detailed plan of progress** for the remainder of your project (both terms). This must consist of a **Gantt chart** and a list of deliverables. 
  
When you submit your first progress report slides, you should also 
- state if **ethical clearance** (also known as ethical approval) is needed for your project (please discuss this with your supervisor, you can learn more about research ethics in a separate section on this KEATS page, where you can also find the ethics choice you must fill in).


# Second Meeting
- Constructivism

- Find similar projects that can inspire me

- READ academic papers (about how to teach data structures)
    CREATE a library or a framework
    USE that library/framework myself or use San Francisco's one.
    The idea is to make the thing more configurable.

- CONSIDER the concrete possibility to add a solid representation of the data structure I am using (graphs or arrays)

# Third Meeting
Literature review about using software for teaching data structure (it can generally be about how DS are evolving or about teaching and all these aspect showing how relevant my solution is) and how it relates to the choices
