Problem space:

Working with machine learning in education [and then I have to come up with a specific problem]


I want to tackle this problem using deep learning:
- I will start decomposing the problem;
- I will compare different de
- ep learning algorithms and approaches;
- I will see which one performs better and choose the one that guarantees me a good solution, etc.

- you will need to demonstrate that you have clearly defined the **problem space** for your project. 
- You should discuss the **motivation and the scope of the project**, list its **aims and objectives** and **include a short bibliography** of relevant literature. 
- You should state what **software platform** (programming language(s), software packages, and software environment), **hardware platform** and **operating system**(s) you will be using. 
- You should also include a **detailed plan of progress** for the remainder of your project (both terms). This must consist of a **Gantt chart** and a list of deliverables. 
  
When you submit your first progress report slides, you should also 
- state if **ethical clearance** (also known as ethical approval) is needed for your project (please discuss this with your supervisor, you can learn more about research ethics in a separate section on this KEATS page, where you can also find the ethics choice you must fill in).
