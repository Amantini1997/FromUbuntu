	Innovative and authentic experiences in learning and teaching Computer Science are hot topics at the moment. The rapid spread of blended and online approaches recently increased awareness and interest around this matter. However, the definition of what are these innovative methods and how to measure their success are still questions that haunt many learners and educators. This project topic is broad on purpose and you will be challenged to research about innovation in Computer Science education, chose a gap of your choice in the literature, formulate research questions, design, implement, compare and assess a solution and a system that answer the research questions. For example, you can develop an open-source completely new plugin to be integrated into a MOODLE environment such as KEATS. You can improve an existent plugin to engage students in a discussion forum using Natural Language Processing techniques. You can implement an automated marking tool and discuss its ethical decisions made by your algorithm or approach.
