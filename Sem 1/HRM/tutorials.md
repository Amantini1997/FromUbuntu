# Week 5 - (4) Recruiting the right talents

**Background**
Banking, the Societe Generale, a French investment bank, bought the Cowen and Company firm, based in the US, in order to expand in such a market. The main focus is to look at the recruiting process happening from this guys working at SG Cowen (born after the merge of Societe General and the Cowen group). SG Cowen is a boutique-sized firm.

So far the company tried to attract talents from the biggest Universities in the country (top 10), 
**Rae** suggests to attract talents from lower ranked Universities as well, up to the top 25. The reason is
> The **best talent from less important schools** are very likely to be students who fully **dedicated to their studies** and who are **more motivated and more loyal**.

How does he attract them? 
Being a boutique-sized firm, it is easier to reach higher roles.

**Skimming process**
At the open day he suggests to the students to reach him at the office (at their own expenses) for informational interviews. This help **students to self-select** themeselves and would prove that someone is really interested in the job.
In the recruiting process

**Reflections on candidates**
1. **Pro** nice guy, good salesman, understands personality aspects and sells
    **Cons** ahead of himself, could be hard to manage.

2. **Pro** commited, very very commited
    **Cons** weak, non-social, nervous, lack of experience especially in banking

3. **Pro** good attitude
    **Cons** not polished (lucido), no accounting skills, issues with maturity

4. **Cons (only)** weak candidate, timid, not talkative, not upbeat (ottimista)
   
According to Rae, Seniors and less seniors both had to come to the interviews. This is beacause senior workers ignore the basic knowledge and focus more on bigger things, whereas younger workers are more rigid on the basic knowledge.

Also, Rae looks a lot at how much people show interest in the job as **long success comes from loving the work** rather than building models.

Another thing Rae pay attention to is the cultural background: in spite of being an amazing candidate, **if you do not fit culturally that's an issue** (the company is based in New York - Wall Street - and a worker has to be ok with what that brings)

Daws (Rae's collegues) consider relevant **how a person dresses up for the event** and what questions they ask. Asking "Are they hours really as bad as they say?" it's not a great one for example.

After every banksman talks to the candidates, it's weird to see how the formers have different opinions on the latter. For example, whereas someone might refer to a candidate as ***"too salesy, I felt he was trying to snow me (kind of like seduce by making compliments)"*** , someone else may say ***"great attitude, eager to contribute"***

The CEO specifies that sometimes, the perfect candidate doesn't fit in the company, that is, the candidate is perfect for a role that the company does not offer. In such cases, the **company has to create the role for them so that they can fit in**.

The interview is over for the candidates and the bankers gather up to judge them.

Among the candidates, a **Polish girls** shines: 
- brilliant analytical skills;
- amazing academic background;
- good working background and a former boss of her gave a good description of her.

> <b>PROBLEM:</b> She doesn't seem to fit well with other people and her English is far from being perfect. If it wasn't for the English, which a couple of people suggest may create issues with clients and managers, she would be the perfect candidate.

The reply to this suspects is that clients are from Wall Street, aka, their English is not great either.

>**Issue with the language and the cultural fit**

----
Also an American dude shined:
- He served in the army for the pasr 4 year, so he has no experience;
- but he's academically prepared and shows confidence, leader characteristic (and experience) and integrates well with people.

> <b>PROBLEM:</b> The issue with this guy? He had many other interviews and may play the card "I want more time" that in fact would mean "I want to consider all the offers". According to the company, if a person doesn't sign straight away, the company offered the place to the wrong person.

>**Plays around, trying to get the best out any opportunity. He might not really be interested in this firm, hence, he might not be very committed**

----
Third dude, great person, he worked at PWC and was in the top 5% of the firm employees, good at taking decision and being in charge.

> <b>PROBLEM:</b> He has a wife and 2 children and has openly confessed to want to **balance his life and being a worker**, probably he's no longer willing to spend to much time aftr banking stuff, he's "too mature" and - one recruiter suggested - he may not be ok taking orders from someone else as he is used to be in charge of stuff 

>**Being a banker requires a lot of time, it is hard to balance between family and work, so he might not focus on the job as much as the firm would expect**


---

Fourth dude, brilliant, high SATs and GMATs scores, probably the highest among the candidates. During his MBA he was running his own business (along the studies) which granted him a 400,000$ revenue.


> <b>PROBLEM:</b> Low score at the MBA, 2.8 / 5.0.

The obvious thing was, as he confirmed, that he did not focus too much on his studies due to the job he was doing, and that, being at the beginning, took him a lot of time away from studying.

> **He's good to me...**

An HR members is important in the selection process as they can take unbiased decisions, they can weight some features in a more proper manner, they can spot personality traits that distinguish an extravert from a nevrotic candidate, and, as a rejected candidate may suit the company for not hiring them even if they meet all the requirements, an HR person can deal with these things, perhaps by clearly specifing the requirements.


# Week - 7 

## RITZ-CARLTON Case study
The history of the Ritz-Carlton is the one of a luxury hotel which guests have always experience an amazing staying. Employees are perhaps the most important resource of the company and their training is fundamental. 

Employees are treated as *ladies and gentlemen* so that the company can retain them and, most importantly, because if the hotel treats them this way, they will treat guest the same way in turn.

The voluntary attrition (abbandono) rate is only 18%, which is well below the industry standard.

Ritz-Carlton realised that the quality of its end products was only as good as the people providing it. They do not "*hire*" people, they "*select*" them. As every employee has to take care of just one task, but they have to do it very well, the company prepared the ideal profile, job description, and quality recruitment based on the top performers from its hotel chain and the other comparable organisations. 

Candidates go through many interviews with different managers and they have to prove worthy of the job and full of empathy, kindness, passion for the job, and the ability to smile naturally.

> Technical skills can be taught, a change in the attitude is instead harder to achieve.

The idea is that people can show no skills, but the training cab teach them. What the training cannot teach them is to be passionate about their job and to smile in every situation.

### After being recruited

**2 day orientation**
After being recruited, the new employees undergo a 2 day orientation program. During this period they are treated like guests, they stay in the hotel rooms, eat at its restaurants, and a top managers welcome them with hand-written welcome cards. This is to ensure that they enjoy their job since day 1.

**21 day training**
After the initial orientation, each new recruit is assigned to and experience employee for 3 weeks of training. The 3 week the recruit performs the job and the actual employees gives feedback on his performance.
Recruits are instructed on the kind of language to use, omn dressing and appearance, and the behaviour with customers.
After this period, the top managers listens to the employee and the feedback; this allows him to check that the behaviour of employees is in line with the Ritz-Carlton philosophy and that the training is good enough.

At the end of the period, the employee takes a test to gauge(valutare) their technical skills and to demonstrate they have learnt the company philosophy. If not, the employee is offer the possibility to either leave or to join a department more suited to them.

**365 Certificate**
The training does not stop after those 21 days and employees are trained until day 365. Here they are tested again and certified.

**On going training**
The training does not stop after the first year and employees keep learning by doing and via courses


Each employee was given $2,000 a day to spend in assisting and helping guests. This gave them a lot of freedom as they did not have to ask for approval from managers, but also great responsibility (you consider them like valuable resources who can handle valuable resources).

Employees were also encouraged to suggest ideas to cut costs down or improving quality. Worthwhile ideas were awarded with cash bonuses. "employees have to feel part of the Ritz-Carlton".

**Why employee prefer RC**
Salaries are not higher than competitors, but employees are treated kindly and respectfully. Also the possibility of escalating the hierarchy lengthens job tenure.
