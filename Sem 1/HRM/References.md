# Week 1 - HRM 
## Hawthorne Experiments

- The lightening experiments (1924-1927)
    > change in the light affect productivity both when the light goes up and when it goes down.
- Relay-assembly Room studies (1928-1929)
    > <small>Women in groups believe they were assessed individually.</small> When the working hours decreased, they were more productive (although at some point they were very productive in an hour, but the final outcome was worse as they were working too little).

People behave differently when they know they are being examined. The theory is not really accepted as the data seems not to be that good.

">HRM to deal with Global talents (8 pages)</a>
    > We currently know little of the role of the corporate human resource (HR) function in multinational corporations regarding global talent management (GTM). GTM is explored here from two perspectives: increasing global competition for talent, and new forms of international mobility. The first considers the mechanisms of GTM, and the second, individual willingness to be mobile, especially in emerging markets, and the organizational capability needed to manage this talent. New corporate HR roles are identified which show how these issues might be addressed. We then advance our understanding of GTM theory and practice by considering the major future challenges facing corporate HR .

">Globalisation implications for human resource management roles (25 pg)</a>
    >Globalization influences organizations that compete for customers with high expectations for performance, quality, and cost. Globalization also exerts pressure on the Human Resource Management (HRM) function to adapt to changing organizational needs and add greater value. This paper first reviews global trends, HRM roles, and the implications of globalization and culture for HRM. Using Ulrich’s (Human resource champions: The new agenda for adding value and delivering results. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1997) HRM model and Hofstede’s (Culture’s consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions and organizations across nations (2nd edition). Sage: Thousand Oaks, CA, 2001, Academy of Management Executive 7:81–94, 1993, Organizational Dynamics 9:42–63, 1980) model of national cultural differences, it is argued that knowledge of global business trends, cultural sensitivity, business knowledge, understanding local employment practices, technical skills, and innovation are increasingly important, especially in Multinational Corporations (MNC)
