# HRM First lecture

---

## PART 1

The main idea of HRM is that organizations can boost productivity and performance by designing and managing work so that they take into account **employees' psychological and social need and aspirations**

>people don't react to work based only on the physical conditions and the characteristics of the technological system. Organizations are social systems, people like to feel that they matter

What is distinctive about HRM (as compared to traditional personnel management)?
- with can obtain higher performances through the application of HR practices;
- practices need to be seen as bundles: they need to fit together and to fit with the strategy of the organization;
- line managers need to cooperate with the HR rules, by committing to and applying them.

### The development of contemporary HRM also benefits from:
 - the decline of union memberships and union influence (probably it means the HR theory is **widespread across the world** and everyone can bring new features and techniques in);
 - the Japanese model (Toyota and Honda mainly) highlighted the importance of managing people by focus a lot on importance of **social aspects** in organizations and things like **teamwork**

## PART 2

####Strategic HRM (SHRM) = Strategic Management + HRM
The idea derived from 2 main points:
- Different [business] strategies require different HR practices;
- Higher performance is the result of alignment between HR strategies and HR strategies and their (business) practices (in the lecture he said HR practices instead).

## There are 3 types of SHRM

### Universalist Perspective (Best practices)
*"There exists a set of best HR practices that, if applied, lead to higher organizational performance"*.

Some of these practices include promotions from within, high wages, incentives, information sharing, employment security, job rotation etc.

The theory says that the more of these practices are applied, the more engaged and satisfied the employee is, and the higher is the employee outcome and the organizational performance. 
It also states thats these practices are equally applicable to each organization regardless of the nature of unique aspects organizations might have; like if this approach could be "**universal**".

**The argument** is that many companies in different sectors managed to be successful using different **sets of management practices**. Furthermore, applying all of these practices is expensive. 
**The evidence**, however, came from many (empirical) studies and stated that the more of these techniques are applied, the betters is the outcome.

### Contingency Perspective (Best Fit)
*"Specific business strategies and goals require specific HR techniques"*.

**The argument** is that you might fall into the trap of **contingency determinism**, which means that the environment is defined as absolute and the solution to that is, in turn, absolute. (i.e. the context absolutely determines the strategy)
> **why is this wrong?**

**The evidence** There is some, not too wide, support for this thesis. Huselid (1995) found out that those organizations that link HRM practices to strategy report higher financial performance outcomes.

### Configurational Perspective (Bundle)
*"There are configurations or patterns of practices - called **bundles** - and the key is to find the most effective one"*.

Bundles are **interrelated** and they mutually reinforce the effect of the others. It is implicit in this that "more is better". 

**The argument** is that finding the right bundle is difficult, and it's hard to prove that a bundle is better than another.

**The evidence** Some tests have failed to prove that specific combinations of practices are better than the total number of HR practices applicable. However, other tests have found support for this approach in the banking sector.


> a key thing to point out is about the changes a Company makes: 
> - when these changes are aimed at improving the working space and the employee benefits, the latter is more committed to work and, of course, happier;
> - vice versa, when the changes are made to cut costs down, or employees are worried about being fired, the commitment levels drop down
